Anxiety is a natural response to stress, but when it becomes overwhelming, it can interfere with daily life. Here are some effective strategies:

- Accept that anxiety is temporary

## Coping Techniques
1. **Deep Breathing**: Practice 4-7-8 breathing technique
2. **Grounding**: Use the 5-4-3-2-1 method (5 things you see, 4 you touch, etc.)
3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and release muscle groups
4. **Mindful Observation**: Focus on the present moment

## When to Seek Help
If anxiety persists for more than 6 months or significantly impacts your life, consider professional help.`,
